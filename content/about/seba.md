Hi, I'm Sebastian.
---
I live in beautiful Hamburg, Germany.   
Here I work as a research assistant pursuing my PhD at the [Hamburg University of Technology](https://www.tuhh.de/index.php?id=32986).

My research interests include   
`Machine Learning`,   
`Stochastic Modeling`,   
`Stochastic Simulation`,  
`Stochastic Optimization`,    
`Markov Chains`,   
applied to `Wireless Communication Networks`,    
and `Cognitive Radio Networks`.

About me
---
On this blog I write about techy, nerdy computer science stuff, possibly related to my research.

On [nomadblog.de](https://nomadblog.de) I write about this great thing called travelling.

You can also find me on [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Lindner2) and [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5694-9675).   
I aim to keep my publications list on Research Gate updated, otherwise ORCID attempts to fetch publications automatically, and the [institute publications site](https://www.tuhh.de/et6/publications.html) is another place to look. 

Education
---
I received my Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Science at the Georg-August-Universität in Göttingen in 2014. I focused on Neuro- and Bioinformatics, especially on the topics of alignment-free DNA and protein sequence analysis. I helped in the lab of Professor Morgenstern where I contributed to several publications in the field, and where I wrote my Bachelor’s thesis on “Clustering metagenomic reads using spaced k-mers”.   

In 2015 I moved to Hamburg to pursue my Master’s degree in Computer Science at the Hamburg University of Technology. Here I specialized in Communication Networks, and in 2018 I received my degree with distinction for my thesis “Game theory applied to device-to-device resource scheduling”.   

Since 2018 I am working as a research assistant pursuing my PhD at the Institute of Communication Networks (ComNets) of the Hamburg University of Technology.
