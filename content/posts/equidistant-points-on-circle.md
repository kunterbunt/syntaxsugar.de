We know that every circle has \\(360\degree = 2\pi\\). It's what makes them round.   
How can we find the `(x,y)` positions of `n` points on a circle in such a way that they're equidistant to the center, and with equal distances between one point and the next?

*Trigonometry* to the rescue! All points *on* a circle are equidistant to the circle's center. Now we just need to space them out so that each point's distance to the next is always the same. So we need to go around the 360 degrees evenly.

For this, we put each point at an angle \\(\theta\\) that goes from 0 to 360 evenly in `n` steps:

$$\theta = \frac{1}{n} \cdot 360,\, \frac{2}{n} \cdot 360,\, \ldots,\, \frac{n}{n} \cdot 360$$

Then we must know that a point `(x,y)` at an angle \\(\theta\\) is located at

$$(x,y) = (x\_0 + r \cdot cos(\theta), y\_0 + r \cdot sin(\theta))$$

where \\(x\_0, y\_0\\) are the center of the circle and \\(r\\) is the circle's radius.

So calculate \\((x,y)\\) for all \\(\theta\\) and you're all set!   
For simplicity's sake, here is some `C++` code that does exactly this and also computes pairwise distances:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

class Coord {
  public:
    Coord(double x, double y) : x(x), y(y) {}
    double x, y;

    double distance(const Coord& other) const {
      return sqrt(pow(x - other.x, 2) + pow(y - other.y, 2));
    }

};

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  if (argc < 5) {
    cerr << "I need parameters: <circle center x> <circle center y> <radius> <number of points>" << endl;
    exit(-1);
  }
  double  radius = atof(argv[1]),
          centerX = atof(argv[2]),
          centerY = atof(argv[3]),
          numPoints = atof(argv[4]);
  cout << "Plotting " << numPoints << " equidistant points on a circle with center (x=" << centerX << ", y=" << centerY
       << ") with radius r=" << radius << ":" << endl;

  vector<Coord> coords;
  for (double i = 0; i < numPoints; i++) {
    double angle = (2 * M_PI) * ((i+1) / numPoints); // For all points the angles sum to 360 degrees = 2Pi.
    double x = centerX + radius * cos(angle);
    double y = centerY + radius * sin(angle);
    coords.push_back(Coord(x, y));
  }

  // Print them.
  cout << "P\tx\ty" << endl;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < coords.size(); i++) {
    cout << (i+1) << "\t" << coords.at(i).x << "\t" << coords.at(i).y << endl;
  }

  // Print pairwise distances.
  for (size_t i = 0; i < coords.size(); i++) {
    for (size_t j = 0; j < coords.size(); j++) {
      cout << "d(" << (i+1) << ", " << (j+1) << ") = " << coords.at(i).distance(coords.at(j)) << endl;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

For `n=6, x0=800, y0=300, r=200` we find:
