I am working on a [Magic Mirror](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/magic-mirror/): that's an old LCD display behind a two-way mirror. The mirror shows your reflection when you look at it, but all light coming from behind it passes through - so stuff displayed on the LCD appears on the mirror. A Raspberry Pi 3 controls what is shown using [this open source modular smart mirror platform](https://magicmirror.builders/).

Of course I don't want the display to be always on - that'd be bad for my electricity bill. Instead I want to detect if a person is standing in front of the mirror and only then turn it on.
For this I'm using a [passive infrared (PIR) sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_infrared_sensor) which connects to three GPIO pins on the raspi.

Some Python then controls the logic:

```python
from gpiozero import MotionSensor
import time
from time import sleep
import subprocess

SENSOR_PIN = 23
stayAliveTime = 30
pir = MotionSensor(SENSOR_PIN)

try:
    lastTimeActivated = time.time()
    subprocess.check_call(['/home/pi/bin/turn-screen', '1'])
    currentlyOn = True
    while True:
	if currentlyOn and not pir.motion_detected and time.time() - lastTimeActivated > stayAliveTime:
            print "Movement stopped on " + time.strftime('%d. %b %X')
            subprocess.check_call(['/home/pi/bin/turn-screen', '0'])
	    currentlyOn = False
	if pir.motion_detected:
            print "Movement detected on " + time.strftime('%d. %b %X')
            lastTimeActivated = time.time()
	    if not currentlyOn:
		subprocess.check_call(['/home/pi/bin/turn-screen', '1'])
		currentlyOn = True
	sleep(0.1)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print "Stopping."
```

In a nutshell: the first `if` checks whether more than `stayAliveTime` many seconds have passed since the display has turned on, and turns off the display if enough time has passed, and the display is on, and there's no motion right now.    
The second `if` covers the other case and checks for motion. Any motion updates the point in time `lastTimeActivated` where the last motion was detected: this way the display stays on if a person keeps moving in front of it. If it's currently off, then it'll also turn on.    

You'll want to install the `gpiozero` package and possibly some dependencies of it.

The `/home/pi/bin/turn-screen` script is quite simple:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if (( $# < 1));
then
	echo "Pass '0' for 'off' and '1' for 'on'!"
	exit
fi
vcgencmd display_power $1
```

and that'll do it!
